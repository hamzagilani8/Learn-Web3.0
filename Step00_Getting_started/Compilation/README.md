## Understanding Compilation process of smart contracts

Smart contract compilation is the process of converting the human-readable code written in a high-level programming language like Solidity into machine-readable bytecode that can be executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The compiler also produces an Application Binary Interface (ABI), which is a JSON file that describes the deployed contract and its functions. This helps bridge the gap between web2 and web3, allowing web applications to interact with smart contracts1.

### Here's a table that summarizes the differences between ABI and Bytecode:

| ABI | Bytecode |
| --- | --- |
| Stands for Application Binary Interface | Stands for low-level machine-readable code |
| JSON file that describes the deployed contract and its functions | Machine-readable code that can be executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) |
| Helps bridge the gap between web2 and web3, allowing web applications to interact with smart contracts | Generated by compiling the human-readable code written in a high-level programming language like Solidity |
| Used by web applications to call the contract's functions | Executed by the EVM to run the contract |
