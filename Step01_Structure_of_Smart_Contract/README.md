# Understanding the structure of a smart contract

Technically, smart contracts have two major elements â€“ variables and functions. There
are multiple facets to both variables and functions in Solidity.

A contract consists of the following multiple constructs:
* State variables
* Structure
* Modifier
* Event
* Enumeration
* Function
